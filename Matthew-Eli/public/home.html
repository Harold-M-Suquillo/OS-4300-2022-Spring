            <h2>This is a project for CSE 4300</h2>
            <p>This is our 4300 project! It is a simple web-based tron game! Tron is a game where you and up to 3 other people all control a light cycle that leaves behind a trail as you drive. Your goal is to avoid hitting any bike's trail for as long as possible.</p>
            <p>If you would like to host a game, enter the number of players and hit host, then send the generated game code to your friends! If you have been given a game code enter it in the other box, and hit join.</p>
